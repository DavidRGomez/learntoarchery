        <h1>Medieval Arrowheads</h1>
          <p>The medieval arrows war had at least one contact point to its target of 100 yards (91 meters) for achieving efficiency is necessary to use heavy and slow arrows. A heavy, slow arrow
             loses much less energy at a given distance 
            than a fast arrow with the same initial kinetic energy.</p>
          <p>It is also true that the penetration of an arrow into an armature is not simply a function of the kinetic energy, it is also a function of the power and shape of the point . For a given initial force of the arc, the momentum (force of the impact of the arrow) is complemented by the weight of the arrow. Little effort was made in the Middle Ages to lighten the weight of the arrow, unlike the current standards on arrows and their weights. Likewise the feathered of these was larger than the current canons. Depending on the type of sleeving or fastening to the shaft, we find three types : <br><br>1) By stinger or punch that was stuck in the wood shaft with the tip to red, then reinforcing the wooden rod with thread of the type that was, very this system used in Eastern towns. 
            <br><br>2) The knife-type tip ends in a flat surface that is inserted into the shaft (like the handle of a knife), reinforcing the shaft with thread. 
            <br><br>3) As the last system would be the insertion of the shaft in the body of the tip itself.<br><br> What is also known for sure is that all the tips were used very well greased (fat of Ox, goose, etc.), oiled or waxed . This was done to increase its penetration power and not to prevent its oxidation since facing the enemy is more dangerous a wound with an object or rusty edge. </p>
        <h2>Bodkin Tips </h2>
          <div><a href=""><img src="images/bodkin1.jpe"></a></div>
          <p>Mainly they were used to perforate the armors , the bodkin took a great variety of forms and measures. The bodkin of the needle took a thin and long form, designed to penetrate the mail and was used early in the medieval period for example in the Battle of Poitiers. I have found some references on hollow needle bodkin, probably to lighten something its weight the back and end that is attached to the shaft of the arrows would be hollow made by crushing the blacksmith the metal forming a cone of sheet metal that later would mold and close to perform the crimp for the wooden stem / shaft. <br> They were conical, fluted, square and triangular. <br><br>
          These models worked well against the armor of the Roman plate that was converted from time into rings. These models were not generally used for hunting, since they were designed to pierce the armor and man inside and were not specifically the best to immobilize a hunting prey.<br>They were used at great distances 300/250 yards (275/225 meters).</p>
        <h2> Broadhead Tips </h2>
          <div><a href="#"><img src="images/broadhead1.jpe"</a></div>  
          <p>Broadheads in general are characterized by a broad and flat profile with long cutting surfaces, intended primarily to slice and cut through the meat. The early broadheads used by the Anglo-Saxons were not "barbed" and were used for large hunting animals such as boar, deer and elk as well as against men in times of war.</p>
